# Hydroponics Monitoring System

## Overview
This web application is designed to monitor key parameters of a hydroponics system, including pH, TDS (Total Dissolved Solids), temperature, and humidity. It provides real-time data visualization and alerts to help manage and maintain optimal growing conditions for hydroponic plants.

## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks pH, TDS, temperature, and humidity levels.
- **Data Visualization**: Graphical representation of data for easy analysis.
- **Alert System**: Alerts users when values fall outside predefined ranges.
- **Responsive Design**: Compatible with various devices, ensuring accessibility from anywhere.

## Technologies Used
- **React JS**: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
- **Redux**: State management for maintaining application state.
- **Firebase**: Backend service for real-time data storage and authentication.
- **Chart.js**: Library for creating interactive charts.
- **React-Bootstrap**: UI components for responsive design.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a Firebase project.
   - Set up Firebase Realtime Database to store sensor data.
   - Enable Firebase Authentication for user authentication (optional).
   - Add Firebase configuration to `.env` file.
4. Start the application: `npm start`

## Usage
1. Sign in to the application (if authentication is enabled).
2. Navigate to the dashboard to view real-time sensor data.
3. Set up alert thresholds in settings to receive notifications.
4. Monitor and manage your hydroponics system efficiently.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
